## Assignment 1
![myplot](https://github.com/Chang-Du/PUI2018_cd2682/blob/master/HW8_cd2682/myplot_cd2682.png)

- The plot shows the normalized distribution of Citibike trips by tripduration in June 2016.
- Red stands for shorter trips and blue stands for the longer trips. Purple is the overlap of red and blue.
- We can see that shorter trips are more than longer trips during weekdays (Monday to Friday) and longer trips are more than shorter trips during weekends (Saturday and Sunday). It is possibly because people use Citibike for commute during weekdays and for hiking on weekends.
