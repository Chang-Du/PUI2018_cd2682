## Assignment 2: Improve my plot from HW8 based on the peer review from tm1722 and ks5063

- Improved the bar chart: The two bar charts used to overlap which may lead to misunderstandings, so I changed it into two separate bars.
- Clarified the legend: Clarified the definition of 'longer trip' and 'shorter trip' in the plot
- The suggestion from ks5063 confused me a little bit. I think the suggestion means to compare the number of trips with trip duration of 25% quantile with 75% quantile. I plot it in this way, however, I do not think it is meaningful to compare them. I did not figure out the practical significance of it so I did not put it in my Assignment 2.
